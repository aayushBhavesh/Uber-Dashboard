### 🚖 Uber Data Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains an interactive **Uber Data Analytics Dashboard** built using **Power BI**.  
It visualizes key metrics about rides, customers, and time-based trends to help understand business performance and improve decision-making.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

The **Uber Dashboard** is designed to analyze and visualize ride-hailing data such as trip frequency, duration, distance, and revenue.  
It helps answer questions like:
- When are rides most frequently booked?  
- Which routes or hours generate the most revenue?  
- How do ride patterns vary over time?  

This project focuses on transforming raw Uber data into **meaningful insights** through data cleaning, modelling, and visualization.
